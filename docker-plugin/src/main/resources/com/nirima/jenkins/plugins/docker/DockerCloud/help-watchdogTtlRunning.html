<div>
	<p>The container watchdog periodically scans the status of the containers on Docker Host 
	created by this Jenkins instance. It verifies if the status on the Docker Host is in sync
	with the status assumed by the Jenkins Server.</p>
	<p>It may happen that Jenkins has already released the slave, but the Docker Host was not
	informed about stopping and terminating the container.</p>
	<p>Therefore, the container watchdog may also serve as garbage collector: It will clean up still running 
	containers, in case that no slave is reported to be running on it anymore. Containers which are still used
	productively and are registered as slave will not be affected.</p>
	<p>The parameter here <b>defines how long such a running container shall have existed before 
	begin removed from Docker Host by the watchdog</b>.</p>
	<p>The value is measured <b>in minutes</b>.</p>
	<p>Specifying a zero value (0) here, disables the cleanup procedure (reporting still will take place)</p>
