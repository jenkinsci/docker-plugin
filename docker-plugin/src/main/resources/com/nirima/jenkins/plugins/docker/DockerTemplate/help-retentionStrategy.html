    <p>Specify the strategy when docker containers shall be started and stopped:</p>
    <dl>
	    <dt><b>Docker Once Retention Strategy</b> (default)</dt>
	    <dd>For each job in the queue, an own docker container is started. Once the job has finished, 
	    the container is shut down.</dd>

	    <dt><b>Docker Cloud Retention Strategy</b> (experimental)</dt>
	    <dd>Based on the workload provided by the queue (load average), new docker containers are started on demand.
	    After the job(s) have finished, the container is not shut down immediately. If no new job was 
	    executed on this slave/container during the period of the Idle delay, the container is shut down.</dd>

	    <dt><b>Keep this slave on-line as much as possible</b> (experimental)</dt>
	    <dd>Starts as many containers as specified in the Instance Capacity (obeying the Container Cap) 
	    and tries to keep them always running (i.e. a new container is started in case another one belonging
	    to this template was shut down).</dd>
	    
	    <dt><b>Take this slave on-line according to a schedule</b> (experimental)</dt>
	    <dd>Based on a cron-schedule slaves are brought on-line and will keep running. 
	    Once the specified period in the schedule is over, the slaves will be shut down.</dd>

	    <dt><b>Take this slave on-line when in demand and off-line when idle</b> (experimental)</dt>
	    <dd>Containers are started if there are jobs waiting for execution in the queue. They are only started,
	    if the jobs are waiting a certain threshold of time there (In demand delay). After the jobs have finished,
	    the container is not shut down immediately. If no new job was 
	    executed on this slave/container during the period of the Idle delay, the container is shut down.</dd>
