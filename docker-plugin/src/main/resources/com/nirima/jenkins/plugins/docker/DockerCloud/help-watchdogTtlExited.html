	<p>The container watchdog periodically scans the status of the containers on Docker Host 
	created by this Jenkins instance. It verifies if the status on the Docker Host is in sync
	with the status assumed by the Jenkins Server.</p>
	<p>If Jenkins does not need a slave anymore, the Docker container may be terminated.
	This process mainly looks like this: The slave process running in the container
	is stopped. Once completed, also the container itself is being stopped. It is then called to be "exited".
	Afterwards, a cleanup of the container should take place. This is done by removing it from the Docker Host.</p>
	<p>If the removing failed or (in error) was not requested, the Docker Host may have "exited" containers in the
	container's overview. Usually, they are of little use, but may drain capacity from the Docker Host.</p>
	<p>Therefore, the container watchdog may also serve as garbage collector: It will clean up "exited" 
	containers. The parameter here <b>defines how long exited containers shall be allowed to remain on the
	Docker Host before being removed by the watchdog</b>.</p>
	<p>The value is measured <b>in minutes</b>.</p>
