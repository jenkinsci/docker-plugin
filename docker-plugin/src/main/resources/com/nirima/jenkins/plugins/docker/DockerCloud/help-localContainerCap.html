    <p>The maximum number of <b>containers</b> that <i>this Jenkins instance</i> is allowed to run on the docker (value is independent of the template/image).</p>
    <p>Note that containers, which have <b>not</b> been created by Jenkins, are <b>not</b> counted by this limit.</p>
    <p>Default value is 2147483647 (the maximal number of containers this plugin may run at a time) 
    which practically disables it by default (compatibility to earlier versions of this plugin).</p> 
    <p>If set to zero, no containers will be provisioned at all.</p>
    
    <h3>Guidance on which Container Cap to use</h3>
    <p>If you are unsure which of the two types of Container Caps you should use, consider the following aspects:
    <ul>
    	<li>If your docker host is used exclusively by this Jenkins instance only, then it does not matter which
    	type of Container Cap you use. For the sake of compatibility, it is recommended that you set the Global Container
    	Cap to the maximal number of containers the docker host can handle. The Local Container Cap shall be set to 2147483647.</li>
    	<li>If you are using DC/Triton, two or more Jenkins instances are sharing the same Triton host, and you are not
    	sharing the same credentials to logon to Triton, then Global Container Cap and Local Container Cap do not differ
    	in the result, too. For the sake of compatibility, it is recommended that you set the Global Container
    	Cap to the maximal number of containers the docker host can handle. The Local Container Cap shall be set to 2147483647.</li>
    	<li>If your docker host is not used exclusively by this Jenkins instance only, or you are using DC/Triton with two 
    	or more Jenkins instances attached which share the same credentials, then you need to closely consider the
    	difference between Global Container Cap and Local Container Cap.</li>
    </ul>
