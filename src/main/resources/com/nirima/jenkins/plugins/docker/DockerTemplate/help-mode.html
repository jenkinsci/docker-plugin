<div>
    Controls how Jenkins schedules builds on this node.

    <dl>
        <dt><b>
            Utilize this node as much as possible
        </b></dt>
        <dd>
            This is the default and normal setting.
            In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build
            that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.
        </dd>

        <dt><b>
            Only build jobs with label restrictions matching this node
        </b></dt>
        <dd>
            In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this node when
            that project is restricted to certain nodes using a label expression,
            and that expression matches this node&apos;s name and/or labels.

            This allows a slave to be reserved for certain kinds of jobs.
            For example, to run performance tests continuously from Jenkins,
            you can use this setting with # of executors as 1, so that only one performance
            test runs at any given time, and that one executor won't be blocked
            by other builds that can be done on other nodes.
