    <p>The operator can constrain the memory available to a container. If the host supports swap memory,
    then the setting can be larger than physical RAM.</p>

    <p>When the processes inside the container exceed the memory limit, effects vary depending on your setup,
    e.g. out of memory errors may occur or the operating system could start killing processes.</p>

    <p>Consult <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/">Docker Run Documentation</a> for further
    information.</p>

    <p>Note that on most Docker installations, the memory limit will not stop Jenkins/Docker from spawning so many
    containers that the machines total available memory will be exceeded. However, some Docker installations might be
    able to constrain the number of containers automatically using the memory limit.</p>
