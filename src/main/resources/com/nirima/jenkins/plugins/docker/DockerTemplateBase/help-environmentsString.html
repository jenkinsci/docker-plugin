<div>
    <p>
    Zero or more environment variables that are set within the docker container.
    This is a multi-line text field.
    Each line must be of the form key=value and specify one variable name and its value.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that quotes are not interpreted.
    <br/>
    e.g. <textarea readonly="true" rows="1" cols="10" class="setting-input">foo="bar"</textarea> will result in the quotes being part of foo's value.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note also that whitespace is easily broken.
    Editing this field this without first expanding the box to its multi-line form
    will cause any whitespace within a line to be turned into end of line codes,
    breaking up the line and thus changing its meaning.
    <br/>
    e.g. The single setting:
    <br/>
    &nbsp;<textarea readonly="true" rows="1" cols="60" class="setting-input">JENKINS_SLAVE_SSH_PUBKEY=ssh-rsa MyPubKey jenkins@hostname&#10;</textarea>
    <br/>
    can be (accidentally) turned into three separate settings:
    <br/>
    &nbsp;<textarea readonly="true" rows="3" cols="60" class="setting-input">JENKINS_SLAVE_SSH_PUBKEY=ssh-rsa&#10;MyPubKey&#10;jenkins@hostname&#10;</textarea>
    <br/>
    thus preventing the configuration from working as was intended.
    </p>
</div>
