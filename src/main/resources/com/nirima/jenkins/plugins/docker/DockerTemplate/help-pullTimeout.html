<div>
    Timeout, in seconds, to apply when expecting data from the Docker API when performing the docker pull operation.
    0 means no time limit, but this is not recommended (if your docker API locks up, some aspects of Jenkins can also lock up).
    <br/>
    i.e. you probably want this set to as long as it takes to pull the entire image onto a fresh docker server.
    e.g. a few minutes.
    <p>
    Note:
    This overrides the read timeout specified for the cloud,
    but only for the docker pull operation
    (as this operation is expected to take longer than most docker operations).
