    Controls how Jenkins schedules builds on this node.<br><br>
    <b>Unchecked - Normal-Mode, utilize this node as much as possible</b><br>
    This is the default and normal setting. In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.<br><br>
    <b>Checked - Exclusive-Mode, leave this node for tied jobs only</b><br>
    In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this node when that project specifically was tied to that node. This allows a slave to be reserved for certain kinds of jobs. For example, to run performance tests continuously from Jenkins, you can use this setting with # of executors as 1, so that only one performance test runs at any given time, and that one executor won't be blocked by other builds that can be done on other nodes.
