<div>
    <p>The maximum number of containers, based on this template, that this provider is allowed to run in total.
    A negative value, or zero, or 2147483647 all mean "no limit" is imposed on the this template,
    although the overall cloud instance limit (if any) will still apply.</p>

    <p>Note that containers which have <b>not</b> been created by Jenkins are not included in this total.</p>

    <p>As an alternative, some Docker setups can also determine the maximum number of containers automatically using
    memory/cpu constraints.</p>
