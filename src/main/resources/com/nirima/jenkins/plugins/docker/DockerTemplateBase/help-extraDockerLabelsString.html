<div>
    <p>A list of new line separated <em>docker</em> labels to be set on the container,
    Specified in the form <code>"label_name=value"</code>.</p>

    <p>This has no effect on Jenkins functionality, and is not related to the labels
    used by Jenkins to map jobs to slave nodes. These labels are metadata attached
    to the docker container itself (again, not the jenkins slave), and which can
    typically be read using the <code>docker inspect</code> command.</p>

    <p>This can be useful when using a docker cluster (like docker swarm) to pass
    information to the scheduler, in conjunction with constraints; or to let
    other services (portainer, prometheus...) know how they should categorize or
    otherwise deal with this specific container.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0">Notes:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0">
    <li>spaces are the beginning and end of the label name and value will be removed</li>
    <li>invalid lines will be ignored</li>
    </ul>
</div>
