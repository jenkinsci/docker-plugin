<div>
    Run a container with the specified user (e.g. "docker run --user ...").
    <br/>
    Refer to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/">docker run command reference</a> for the correct syntax.
    Note that you have to specify a numeric uid if you want to run a container as a user,
    which exists on the host machine but does not exist within the container.
