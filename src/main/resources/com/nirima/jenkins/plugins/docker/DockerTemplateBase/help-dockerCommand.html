    Specifies a command to be executed upon containter start. Note this setting might have impact on the Launch mechanism,
    for example SSH Launcher do configure sshd with injected keys authentication, overriding this command might
    prevent the agent to start. Please refer to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cmd-default-command-or-options">docker documentation</a>
    for more details.

    Supplied command must keep the container running, so Jenkins can establish a remote connection at
    any time. If not set, Jenkins will configure a general purpose command to just wait for stdin.

    If you need your image to start some additional services, you should consider using an Entrypoint, and
    follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#entrypoint">best practices</a>
    so that the command is eventually executed by your entrypoint script.
