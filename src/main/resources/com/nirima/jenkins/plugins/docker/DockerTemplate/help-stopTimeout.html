<div>
    Timeout, in seconds, to apply when stopping the container after a job has finished.
    The default of 10s is fine for most cases.
    However, if you container needs to do some cleanup after the slave has stopped you can increase the timeout.
    If the container fails to stop gracefully before the timeout ends, the container will be killed.
