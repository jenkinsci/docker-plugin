<div>
    Timeout, in seconds, to apply when expecting data from the Docker API.
    0 means no time limit, but this is not recommended (if your docker API locks up, some aspects of Jenkins can also lock up).
    <p>
    NOTE: This timeout does not apply to all docker API actions.
    Docker pull requests (which can take some time to complete) have their own value specified in the template.
    Docker image builds have no timeout at all (you with want a timeout, use an inactivity timeout on your build as a whole).
    <br/>
    i.e. you probably want this set to a few seconds, e.g. as long as it takes for your docker service to respond to a &quot;container start&quot; request.
